<h2>When She Gets Stuck To The Window Screen</h2>
<hr>
<p>Does your cat manage to get stuck to the window screen every single day 
without fail? Even if you trim her claws frequently and make sure to keep 
them short? Have you ever come home from work to find your cat stuck? Who 
knows how long she's been sitting there. 
<b>Well, follow these simple instructions to free her!</b>
</p>
<h3>The Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ask her: "<i>Are You Stuck Again??</i>"</li>
<li>Make sure to give her a good scratch</li>
<li>Gently lift up (&uparrow;) her paw, while soothing her with your calming 
    voice</li>
<li>Give her some love &hearts;</li>
</ol>
